This lab8 folder contains four programs written in four different programming languages. C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
This file will provide information on the programs and how to run them.



C++

In the c++ folder, you will see a folder named tictactoe where the program files are kept.
The file called tic is the compiled tictactoe program.

This program is a tictactoe game in which two players take turns choosing a number corresponding to a place on a tictactoe board.

To run the program, simply run the executable 'tic' file. If this doesn't work you will have to compile the program by using the program g++ from the build-essential package that can be installed. Simply run $ sudo g++ tictactoemain.cpp and then the newly created file a.out to start the program.

---------------

perl

In the perl file is a random password generator program that does exactly what the name implies.

It can be run by first typing in 'perl' in the terminal then the name of the file.

--------------

python

In the python folder there is a program called 8ball.py. It is a magic 8 ball that prompts a question then gives a randomized response. 

The python program can be run by typing python followed by the name of the file.

---------------

ruby

In the ruby folder is a program called personalInfo. It asks for your age and height and then prints them out in a sentence. 

This requires that you install ruby then can be run by ./personalInfo.rb
